## Short Description

[Inferno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_Comedy#Inferno) (as its name suggests) is a Monopoly based interactive multiplayer game discord bot completely based on the theme Sin City [Las Vegas]. As soon as you step into the game you enter the Sin City of Vegas. Here you can visit all the famous attractions purchase them, collect rent, gamble, land yourself in great trouble(smuggling drugs) or in great luck( winning a jackpot). At the end, the player with the most balance + property value is crowned as the conquerer of Sin City.

##  Slash Commands
 
| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/play` | Create a new game and open the lobby. The host can then invite others to join. |
| `/status` | Show current player balances, board positions, lap counts, and properties owned. |
| `/exit` | Force-end the current game and display the final SIN-O-METER standings. |
 
---
 
##  How to Play
 
1. One player types `/play` — a lobby message appears with **Join Game** and **Start Game** buttons
2. Other players (up to 5 total) click **Join Game**
3. The host clicks **Start Game** (minimum 2 players required)
4. Players take turns clicking ** Roll Dice**
5. The bot moves the player's token and resolves the tile they land on
6. The game ends when any player completes **4 laps**, or a player goes bankrupt
7. The **SIN-O-METER** leaderboard is displayed — most broke player at the top, richest at the bottom

##  Game Rules
 
###  Starting Balance
Each player starts with **$1,500**.
 
###  GO
- Passing GO awards **+$50**
- Landing directly on GO also awards **+$50**
 
###  Properties
- Landing on an unowned property shows **Buy** and **Skip** buttons
- Buying a property marks that tile with your player colour on the board
- Landing on a property owned by another player deducts rent from your balance and pays it to the owner
 
###  Slot Machine
- Landing on a Slot Machine shows **Spin ($50)** and **Skip** buttons
- Spinning costs $50 upfront, then awards or deducts a random amount based on weighted tiers:
 
| Tier | Probability | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
|  JACKPOT | 5% | +$300 |
|  BIG WIN | 10% | +$150 |
|  WIN | 20% | +$75 |
|  PUSH | 25% | ±$0 |
|  LOSS | 20% | −$75 |
|  BIG LOSS | 14% | −$150 |
|  RUINOUS | 6% | Lose entire balance |
 
###  Event Cards
- The active player draws a hidden card (gain or loss)
- All other players have **10 seconds** to vote: **Support**, **Oppose**, or **Skip**
- Supporters and opposers win or lose a side-bet (20% of the card's value)
- The card is revealed after voting closes
 
###  Jail
- **Go To Jail** tile teleports you to Jail immediately
- **Landing on Jail** (visiting) — you are not locked in
- If you are in Jail on your turn, you can:
  - Pay **$150 bail** to escape and roll normally
  - Roll dice — if you get doubles you escape for free and move that many spaces
 
###  Free Parking
Nothing happens — enjoy the rest.
 
###  End Game
- The game ends the moment any player completes their **4th lap**
- The final **SIN-O-METER** shows: Cash + Property Value = Total Wealth
- Ranking is **ascending** — most broke (most sinful) at the top, richest at the bottom

##  Installation
 
### Prerequisites
 
| Requirement | Minimum Version |
|---|---|
| [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) | v18.0.0 |
| npm | Included with Node.js |
| A Discord account | — |
 
---
 
### Step 1 — Create a Discord Bot Application
 
1. Go to [discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Click **New Application** → give it a name (e.g. `Inferno`) → click **Create**
3. In the left sidebar click **Bot**
4. Click **Reset Token** → confirm → **copy the token** and save it somewhere safe
5. On the same page scroll down and enable all three **Privileged Gateway Intents**:
   -  Presence Intent
   -  Server Members Intent
   -  Message Content Intent
6. Click **Save Changes**
 
---
 
### Step 2 — Invite the Bot to Your Server
 
1. In the left sidebar go to **OAuth2 → URL Generator**
2. Under **Scopes** check: `bot` and `applications.commands`
3. Under **Bot Permissions** check:
   -  Send Messages
   -  Attach Files
   -  Read Message History
   -  Use Slash Commands
   -  Embed Links
4. Copy the generated URL at the bottom → paste it in your browser
5. Select your server → click **Authorise**
 
---
 
### Step 3 — Get Your IDs
 
Enable Developer Mode in Discord first: **Settings → Advanced → Developer Mode → ON**
 
| ID | How to get it |
|---|---|
| **Client ID** | Developer Portal → your application → **General Information** → copy **Application ID** |
| **Guild ID** | Right-click your server icon in Discord → **Copy Server ID** |
 
---
 
### Step 4 — Set Up the Environment File
 
In the **root of the project folder**, create a file named `.env` and add:
 
```env
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
CLIENT_ID=your_application_id_here
GUILD_ID=your_server_id_here
```
 
 
---
 
### Step 5 — Install Dependencies
 
```bash
npm install

### Step 6 — Register Slash Commands
 
Run this **once** to register the bot's commands with Discord. Re-run it any time you add or rename a command.
 
```bash
node src/discord/registerCommands.js
```
 
Expected output:
```
 Registering GUILD commands (instant) for guild: 123456789...
 Guild commands registered.
```
 
> **To clear all commands** (fixes duplicate command issues):
> ```bash
> CLEAR=true node src/discord/registerCommands.js
> ```

```bash
npm start
```
 
Expected output:
